Ideas for things to add/change.
-------------------------

- Instead of sending a SETEVENTS command and installing a custom
  Handler in two steps, there should be a catalog of ready-made functions
  that make sending the SETEVENTS command and installing a Handler a
  single call.

- Status codes like "551 Internal error" shouldn't be just integers but
  implement the error interface.
