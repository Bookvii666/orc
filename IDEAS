Ideas for things to add/change.
--------------------------------

- All the methods implementing special types of commands (GetInfo, GetConf,
  SetInfo, ...) should receive the onion routers reply and return useful
  information.

- Status codes like "551 Internal error" shouldn't be just integers but
  implement the error interface.

- It should be possible to handle asynchronous replies using a framework
  similar to the Handler(Func) system in net/http. It would be best if
  installing a Handler for an event, could automatically send a SETEVENTS
  command for this type of event.

- The Conn.SyncReplies channel should probably be removed: for synchronous
  replies there is no need to use channels for synchronization and users can
  easily implement this themselves.
